    "This dataset describes housing values in Boston. Below are the features:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town.\n",
    "- **ZN**: Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n",
    "- **INDUS**: Proportion of non-retail business acres per town.\n",
    "- **CHAS**: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise).\n",
    "- **NOX**: Nitric oxide concentration (parts per 10 million).\n",
    "- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.\n",
    "- **AGE**: Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940.\n",
    "- **DIS**: Weighted distances to five Boston employment centres.\n",
    "- **RAD**: Index of accessibility to radial highways.\n",
    "- **TAX**: Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000.\n",
    "- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio by town.\n",
    "- **LSTAT**: % lower status of the population.\n",
    "- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's.\n",
